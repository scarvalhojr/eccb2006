We will accept long papers, corresponding to “Original papers” in the categories of the journal Bioinformatics (5-7 pages long, at least 10-point type). We strongly encourage the use of the LaTeX or Word templates available for download farther down this page in order to facilitate processing of accepted papers. Using the templates will also enable you to accurately estimate the number of pages of your paper. The preferred submission format is PDF, though Postscript and Word files are acceptable as well
